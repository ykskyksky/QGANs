# QGANs

Reference paper is [Quant GANs: Deep Generation of Financial Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06673)

Project goals:

◆ Implement QuantGANs adjusting the code of [Quant GANs replication](https://github.com/ICascha/QuantGANs-replication) and test on the latest data of Japanese stock index.

Result:

◆ Although I adjusted and update the code, I could not get over convert_to_tensor problem in the training part.
